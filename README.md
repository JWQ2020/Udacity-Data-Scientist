## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code, which is in the file Analysis.ipynb, should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

The zip file, survey_results_public.zip, is the dataset. Because of its large size, it has been uploaded to GitHub as a zip file. It should be unzipped before running Analysis.ipynb, and placed in the same directory as the code, and the schema file, survey_results_schema.csv.

## Project motivation
As someone learning coding and data science in order to further my career, I was interested to use the Stake Overflow Developer Survey of 2019 to understand what factors affect income, working horus and job satisfaction for developers today. I wanted to find out the following:
1. In Western Europe, is there a link between what languages you work with and earning a higher income?
1. Which developer types have the longest working hours per week?
1. What are the most important job factors associated with job satisfaction?



## File descriptions
There is one notebook available here, Analysis.ipynb, to showcase work related to the above questions, and is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

The zip file, survey_results_public.zip, is the dataset. Because of its large size, it has been uploaded to GitHub as a zip file. It should be unzipped before running Analysis.ipynb.

The associated schema is survey_results_schema.csv. A pdf file of the original survey as it appeared on Stack Overflow is so_survey_2019.pdf.

The dataset, schema and original survey were obtained from the Kaggle page linked in the section [Licensing, authors, acknowledgements.](#Licensing,-authors,-acknowledgements)


## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here:
